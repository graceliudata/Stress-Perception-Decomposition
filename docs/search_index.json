For column patterns, we can see that the top 3 variables have the most missing data: non_heteronormative_3_TEXT, gender_idetity_5_TEXT and race_12_TEXT This is quite reasonable since these variables are used to store the explanation part if people choose the other option for variable non_heteronormative, gender_idetity and race, respectively. Therefore, the reason why these 3 columns has leading missing values is people choose common options but rarely the other option for non_heteronormative, gender_idetity and race variables. ## missing % ## non_heteronormative_3_TEXT 201 100 ## gender_idetity_5_TEXT 199 99 ## race_12_TEXT 197 98 ## mother_education 62 31 ## father_education 62 31 ## period 58 29 ## gender_idetity 47 23 ## contraceptive 26 13 ## loc2 20 10 ## household_income 20 10 ## loc1 19 9 ## loc3 19 9 ## coherence6 19 9 ## sibling_age 19 9 ## focus1 18 9 ## focus2 18 9 ## focus3 18 9 ## focus4 18 9 ## focus5 18 9 ## focus6 18 9 For row patterns, with each row represents a student survey results, we found that there were 17 out of 201 students that only fill out a few of survey question and then quit. In fact, we decide to remove those who did not fill out at least 75% of the survey for data cleaning. ## [1] 4 4 4 6 5 4 5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 179 6 ## [27] 180 4 4 4 5 178 5 5 7 5 5 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 178 6 6 5 5 ## [53] 5 5 6 5 4 6 5 7 6 5 5 5 5 6 5 5 8 5 7 5 179 3 3 6 75 3 ## [79] 3 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 180 3 179 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 3 3 178 178 3 4 3 4 ## [105] 165 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 179 3 3 180 2 3 3 4 3 3 3 3 4 3 3 ## [131] 6 178 8 3 3 154 3 3 5 178 3 4 3 3 3 3 4 3 4 4 3 5 3 3 3 3 ## [157] 3 2 3 3 3 5 5 3 3 4 3 3 3 3 179 3 3 3 1 4 3 4 6 3 3 5 ## [183] 3 3 3 3 3 4 180 4 3 4 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 4 4 Here is a heatmap for row/column missing pattern, where x-axis for columns (survey questions), y-axis for row index (id for students) 1.While yellow cells indicates missing data, we can see patterns of 3 vertical yellow lines (top 3 variables with missing values) and 17 horizontal yellow lines (17 students miss more than 75% questions) 2.There is another pattern that students with id 31-73 have missing values for variable father_education and mother_education. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD # Interactive component One of the questions were interested in is how our students react to different types of content and what kinds of issues cause them more stress than others. We created a stacked bar chart to illustrate our findings: Based on our stacked bar chart, we could tell that there are more vignettes in categories like Work/Education, Discrimination and Misc, and there are relatively less vignettes in Health/Accicdent than other categories. For content in regard to Discrimination and Finances, there are a larger portion of students that feel high level of stress. This founding makes sense since college students are typically young adults that lack financial literacy and economic stability, and race has always been a sensitive issue that causes stress on people and especially young people. There is a larger portion of students that are indifferent about content related to Health/Accident, which also makes sense considering that college students are typically in good health and health may be least of their worries. However, it suprises me that there is also a sightly larger portion of students that are indifferent about content related to Discrimination, which may indicate that some people may be less conscious about issues relating to race, although there are also a large percentage of people that are very conscious about that. The survey in Session 2 seems to reflect an overall lower level of stress comparing to the results from Session 1, which may be effected by external factors such as the time period where our survey were conducted. ======= # Interactive component One of the questions were interested in is how our students react to different types of content and what kinds of issues cause them more stress than others.
